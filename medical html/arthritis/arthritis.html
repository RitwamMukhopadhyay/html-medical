                Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>                Osteoarthritis causes cartilage - the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint - to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining
                of joints.
                <br> Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.<br> Treatments vary depending on the type
                of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.<br>

        <h2>
            <a name="causes">Causes</a>
        </h2>

        <h4>
            The two main types of arthritis -- osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis -- damage joints in different ways.
        </h4>
        <h3>Osteoarthritis</h3>

        <h4>The most common type of arthritis , osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to your joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless
            joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection.<br> Osteoarthritis
            also affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. It also causes inflammation of the joint lining.
        </h4>

        <h3>Rheumatoid arthritis</h3>

        <h4>
            In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage
            and bone within the joint.

    <!--TREATMENT-->

        <h2>
            <a name="treatment">Treatment</a>
        </h2>
        <article>
            Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or combinations of treatments, before you determine what works best for you.
        </article>

        <h3>
            Medications
        </h3>
        <h4>
            The medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include:
        </h4>
        <li>
            <strong>Painkillers.</strong> These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation. An over-the-counter option includes acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). For more-severe pain, opioids might be prescribed, such as tramadol
            (Ultram, ConZip), oxycodone (OxyContin, Roxicodone, others) or hydrocodone (Hysingla, Zohydro ER). Opioids act on the central nervous system to relieve pain. When opioids are used for a long time, they may become habit-forming, causing mental
            or physical dependence.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</strong> NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Some types of NSAIDs are available only by
            prescription. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation and may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. Some NSAIDs are also available as creams or gels, which can be rubbed on joints.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Counterirritants.</strong> Some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the ingredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint may interfere with the transmission
            of pain signals from the joint itself.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</strong>Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints. Examples include methotrexate (Trexall, Rasuvo, others) and hydroxychloroquine
            (Plaquenil).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Biologic response modifiers.</strong>Typically used in conjunction with DMARDs, biologic response modifiers are genetically engineered drugs that target various protein molecules that are involved in the immune response.
            <p>There are many types of biologic response modifiers. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are commonly prescribed. Examples include etanercept (Enbrel, Erelzi, Eticovo) and infliximab (Remicade, Inflectra, others).</p>
            <p>Other medications target other substances that play a role in inflammation, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Janus kinase enzymes, and certain types of white blood cells known as B cells and T cells.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Corticosteroids. </strong>This class of drugs, which includes prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and cortisone (Cortef), reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or can be injected
            directly into the painful joint.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h3>
            Therapy
        </h3>
        <p>Physical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            Surgery
        </h3>
        <h4>
            if conservative measures don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as:
        </h4>
        <li>
            <strong>Joint repair.</strong>In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically — through small incisions over the joint.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Joint replacement. </strong>This procedure removes your damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Joint fusion. </strong>This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one
            rigid unit.
        </li>

    <!--DIAGNOSIS-->
    <div>
        <h2>
            <a name="diagnosis">Diagnosis</a>
        </h2>
        <p>During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she will also want to see how well you can move your joints. Depending on the type of arthritis suspected, your doctor may suggest some of the
            following tests.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Laboratory tests
        </h3>
        <p>
            The analysis of different types of body fluids can help pinpoint the type of arthritis you may have. Fluids commonly analyzed include blood, urine and joint fluid. To obtain a sample of your joint fluid, your doctor will cleanse and numb the area before
            inserting a needle in your joint space to withdraw some fluid.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            Imaging
        </h3>
        <p>These types of tests can detect problems within your joint that may be causing your symptoms. Examples include:</p>
        <li>
            <strong>X-rays.</strong>Using low levels of radiation to visualize bone, X-rays can show cartilage loss, bone damage and bone spurs. X-rays may not reveal early arthritic damage, but they are often used to track progression of the disease.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Computerized tomography (CT).</strong>CT scanners take X-rays from many different angles and combine the information to create cross-sectional views of internal structures. CTs can visualize both bone and the surrounding soft tissues.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong>Combining radio waves with a strong magnetic field, MRI can produce more-detailed cross-sectional images of soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Ultrasound.</strong>This technology uses high-frequency sound waves to image soft tissues, cartilage and fluid-containing structures near the joints (bursae). Ultrasound is also used to guide needle placement for joint aspirations
            and injections.
