            <strong>What Is Ankylosing Spondylitis?</strong>
            <p>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a rare type of arthritis that causes pain and stiffness in your spine. This lifelong condition, also known as Bechterew disease, usually starts in your lower back. It can spread up to your neck or damage joints
                in other parts of your body.</p>
            <p>"Ankylosis" means fused bones or other hard tissue. "Spondylitis" means inflammation in your spinal bones, or vertebrae. Severe cases can leave your spine hunched.</p>
            <p>There’s no cure for AS. But medication and exercise can ease pain and help keep your back strong.</p>

            <p>Not everyone develops all of the following symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, arthritis of the spine. What you experience depends on the severity of the condition:</p>
            <li>Stiffness and pain in the lower back, buttocks, and hips upon waking in the morning or after a period of inactivity</li>
            <li>Back pain relieved by movement and exercise</li>
            <li>Difficulty bending the spine</li>
            <li>Pain in the hips and difficulty walking</li>
            <li>Pain in the heels and soles of the feet</li>
            <li>Pain in the jaw, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)</li>
            <li>Bent-over posture</li>
            <li>Straightening of the normal curvature of the spine</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite, weight loss</li>
            <li>Fatigue, decreased energy</li>
            <li>Eye swelling, redness, and pain</li>
            <li>Sensitivity to light</li>
            <li>Difficulty taking a deep breath (because expanding the chest is difficult and painful)</li>
            <li>Heart failure</li>
            <li>Heart block (problems with the flow of the electrical impulses that control your heart muscle)</li>
            <li>Bowel inflammation like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis</li>

        <h2>

        </h2>
        <article>
            <p>There is no specific test to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis, but imaging by X-ray and MRI may show evidence of inflammation of the sacroiliac joint between the sacrum (the triangular bone at the lowest part of the back) and the ilium (the
                bone felt on the upper part of the hip). Some symptoms may include:</p>
            <li>Inflammatory back pain (gradual in onset, lasting over three months, with stiffness and pain that is worse in the morning and improved with movement)</li>
            <li>Reduced mobility of the spine</li>
            <li>Reduced ability to expand the chest</li>
            <p>Your doctor may order a number of different blood tests that can suggest ankylosing spondylitis. For example, if you have the disorder, you are likely to have an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells settle
                out of your blood) and increased levels of C-reactive protein (a protein that is usually not in blood at high levels but may be elevated in cases of inflammation). These two tests are general indications of inflammation in your body.</p>
            <p>You may also have anemia. To exclude other causes of inflammatory arthritis, tests for rheumatoid factor (an antibody common in cases of rheumatoid arthritis) and anti-nuclear antibodies (common in cases of lupus and other similar conditions)
                may be ordered, which are usually negative in ankylosing spondylitis. Between 85-90% of Caucasian people with ankylosing spondylitis are positive for the HLA-B27 marker.

    <!--TREATMENT-->

        </h2>
        <article>
            <p>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a lifelong condition that has no cure. But several types of medications may stop or delay more spinal problems and ease your pain and swelling. That -- along with exercise and a healthy diet -- would help you
                to move better and to keep or slow your condition from worsening. </p>
            <p>AS is not the same as non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nrAxSpA). But experts think the conditions sometimes can be two stages of the same disease. So you’ll probably get the same treatment for both.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>NSAIDs</h3>
            <p>The first thing your doctor will have you try is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Some are sold over the counter and others are prescription only. They calm AS-related pain by stopping your body from making inflammation-causing
                chemicals called prostaglandins. If you take NSAIDs at night, they may help you sleep so you feel better in the morning.</p>
            <p>NSAIDs that may help with AS include:</p>
            <li>Celecoxib (Celebrex)</li>
            <li>Diclofenac/Misoprostol (Arthrotec)</li>
            <li>Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin)</li>
            <li>Indomethacin (Tivorbex)</li>
            <li>Meloxicam (Mobic)</li>
            <li>Naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn)</li>
            <br>
            <p>It may take several weeks for you to feel better. If you use NSAIDs for a long time, they may hurt your stomach. You may also get:</p>
            <li>Heartburn</li>
            <li>Stomach inflammation</li>
            <p>Your doctor may want you to take an antacid and other drugs to protect your stomach lining. Tell your doctor if you have a history of heart disease. NSAIDs can make you more likely to get a heart attack or stroke.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>DMARDs</h3>
            <p>NSAIDs may not control all of your symptoms. Your doctor may also want you to take disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This group of different medications works to limit the tissue damage from inflammation.</p>
            <p>Your doctor may prescribe:-</p>
            <li>Methotrexate (Otrexup, Rasuvo, Rheumatrex, Trexall)</li>
            <li>Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Corticosteroids</h3>
            <p>These drugs are a type of steroid hormone that your body makes naturally. You may get a shot of a man-made version called prednisone. This can help ease pain and swelling in specific spots. But your doctor won’t use it for your whole body.
                And you may be able to get shots for your inflamed joints only a few times a year, a few months apart. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Biologics</h3>
            <p>If other treatments don’t work, your doctor may try a drug made from living organisms. These biologics help your immune system block proteins called cytokines responsible for inflammation. You can give yourself a shot of a biologic medication
                at home.</p>
            <p>Types include:</p>
            <em>TNF inhibitors.</em>
            <p>TNF stands for tumor necrosis factor. These drugs can treat inflammation in your joints, gut, eyes, and spine. They may slow the growth of your disease. Each medicine works in a different way. If one doesn’t help, your doctor may switch you
                to a different one.</p>
            <p>These five TNF inhibitors are approved by the FDA to treat AS:</p>
            <li>Adalimumab (Humira)</li>
            <li>Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia)</li>
            <li>Etanercept (Enbrel)</li>
            <li>Golimumab (Simponi)</li>
            <li>Infliximab (Remicade)</li>
            <em>Interleukin inhibitors.</em>
            <p>These are also called IL-17 inhibitors. Your doctor may want you to try them if you don’t respond to TNF inhibitors. You may get fewer side effects.</p>
            <p>The FDA has approved two IL-17 inhibitors for AS. They are:</p>
            <li>Ixekizumab (Taltz)</li>
            <li>Secukinumab (Cosentyx)</li>
            <p>Biologics raise your chances for infections like tuberculous (TB). You will need a TB test before you start treatment. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Pain Medications</h3>
            <p>You should feel better when you treat your inflammation. But it may take some time for you to find the right medicine. If you still hurt, ask your doctors if you should take something just for pain. They can tell you if any over-the-counter
                or prescription painkillers may help.</p>
